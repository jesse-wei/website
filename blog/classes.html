    This list contains only classes related to my majors. That is, it does not contain EDUC101, SPHG101, and LFIT103.

            <li>
                MATH521: Advanced Calculus I (C-)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Took the class with Shrawan Kumar, who hadn't taught the class in 20 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From a classmate in MATH566 - 10 people I've talked to who took that 21F class with him Failed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From me - there were at most 40 people in the class on the first day of class. Many dropped by the end, of course.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not sure how much of what my classmate said is exaggeration, but 25% F is definitely abnormal based on historic grade distributions from <a href="http://www.gradetoday.com/instructors/5842">GradeToday</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>22S</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                COMP311: Computer organization (A)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Before the professor added 1% to everyone's grades (for meeting 85% course evaluation target), only 6/216 people had A's.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                COMP550: Algorithms and analysis (A)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This professor's algorithms class is less rigorous than it should be due to automated positive feedback on exams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Considering how important algorithms are to CS majors, this is quite terrible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                MATH548: Combinatorics (A)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The professor made the class beyond easy to do well in.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                STOR535: Probability for data science (A)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        STOR435 (OG version of the class without programming homework assignments) has a pretty bad reputation, but this professor made the class decently easy (30% A).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>22SSI</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MATH566: Introduction to numerical analysis
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>22SSII</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PHYS114: General physics I: for students of the life sciences
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Either this class or PHYS118 (harder) satisfies the PHYS requirement for the math B.S.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After my MATH521 grade, however, I'm going to lean toward maintaining my GPA.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                CHIN212: Intermediate written chinese
            </li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
