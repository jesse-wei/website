    <h1>Pascal's triangle</h1>

        Consider the following question: In the polynomial expansion of $(x+y)^5$, what is the coefficient of the
        $x^2y^3$ term? You could expand this out as$$(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)$$
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, this would take forever. Is there a better way
        <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">The answer's yes, of course.</span>?
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the following situation: you have 5 boxes, each with one $x$ and $y$, and you have to choose one
        element from each box. How many different ways are there to pick out 2 $x$'s and 3 $y$'s? In actuality, this is
        precisely the same question.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now consider a simpler case, as we should usually do when something appears difficult. What is the coefficient
        of
        the $x^5$ term? Clearly, it is 1. We know that because there's only one way to get $x^5$: pick out an $x$ from
        each one of the 5 binomials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applying this to the $x^2y^3$ example, we know that its coefficient should be the number of ways to pick out 2
        $x$'s and 3 $y$'s. How many ways is that? We can pick 2 $x$'s from the first two, and that would automatically
        fix 3 $y$'s from the last 3 binomials. We could also pick out 2 $x$'s from the last two, and that would also
        automatically give us 3 of $y$. Does this seem like a familiar concept?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are $\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5(4)}{2}=10$ ways to pick out 2 $x$'s (fixing 3 $y$'s also)
        from 5 of $(x+y)$. By intuition and the identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$, we know $\binom{5}{3}$, which
        can be interpreted as the number of ways to pick out 3 $y$'s and fixing 2 $x$'s, is also 10.
        <label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k))!} =
            \binom{n}{n-k}$</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The binomial coefficient naturally has the symmetry $\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n}{n-k}$, which tells us that if the
        coefficient of $x^2y^3$ is $\binom{5}{2}$ (from 5 boxes pick 2 $x$), and the coefficient of $x^3y^2$ is
        $\binom{5}{3}$ (from 5 boxes pick 3 $x$), then those two
        numbers are the same. After all, by inspection, why wouldn't they be? The number of ways to pick out 2 $x$'s
        from 5 of $(x+y)$ is the same as the number of ways to pick out 2 $y$'s.
    </p>
    <p>
        This would also imply the coefficient of $xy^4$, $\binom{5}{1}$, should be the same as the coefficient of
        $x^4y$, $\binom{5}{4}$. And, back to where we started, the coefficient of $x^5$, $\binom{5}{5}$, is the same as
        the coefficient of $y^5$, $\binom{5}{0}$.
    </p>

    <p>
        Knowing now that binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \ldots ,\binom{n}{n}$ are the coefficients
        of $(x+y)^n$, what if we arrange these binomial coefficients in a triangle like so:
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, that doesn't look like much. But when we compute the numbers, we get
    </p>

    <img src="/img/blog/pascal-nums.jpg" alt="Pascal's triangle" class="center">

    <p>
        And hopefully you've seen this before, so you know that each number in the triangle is the sum of the two
        numbers above it!

        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">
            If there's no number, pretend it's a 0. And for the top-most 1, that's our base case, have to start
            somewhere.</span>
        To reiterate, note that row $n$ matches the coefficients of $(x+y)^n$. You can verify this for yourself using
        this embedded Mathematica code!

        <span class="sidenote">Here, I change to $(1+x)^n$ because it's more conventional, but the concept remains the
            same. By the way, you should try out negative inputs!</span>

        Well, there's just one more thing... if we know that the above two triangles are the same, then doesn't that
        necessarily mean that the addition property that holds for the numerical triangle holds for the binomial
        coefficient triangle as well? In other words, looking at the middle of the triangle, since $3+3=6$,
        $\binom{3}{1}+\binom{3}{2}=\binom{4}{2}$? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        First, let's set up the theorem. Let $\binom{n}{k}$ represent the $k^{\text{th}}$ entry of the $n^{\text{th}}$
        row of the binomial coefficient form of Pascal's triangle. Since each number in the numerical Pascal's triangle
        is the sum of the two numbers above, we claim that $\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}$.

        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">You should check that this statement does, indeed, refer to an arbitrary entry and the
            two entries above it. You could confirm using the $\binom{4}{2}$ example.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="lemma">$\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}$</a></div>
    <div class="proof">
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} &= \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-k-1)!}\\
        &= (n-1)!\left[\frac{1}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{1}{k!(n-k-1)!}\right]\\
        &= (n-1)!\left[\frac{k}{k!(n-k)!} + \frac{n-k}{k!(n-k)!}\right]\\
        &= (n-1)!\left(\frac{n}{k!(n-k)!}\right)\\
        &= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\
        &= \binom{n}{k}

        You can also head to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule#Combinatorial_proof">Wikipedia</a>
        for a very good combinatorial reasoning (no algebra) proof. I'll prove another cool identity using combinatorial
        reasoning:
    </p>
    <div class="lemma">$k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1}$</div>
    <div class="proof">Let $n$ be the total number of people, and suppose we want to pick out a group of $k$ people with
        one special person in the group, perhaps a president. There are two ways for us to accomplish this: (1) select
        the group first and then within the group, select a president or (2) select a president among all people, then
        form the rest of the group.
        <label for="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">This should make intuitive sense.</span>
        <p>
            The first way involves first picking out $k$ people from $n$ people. There
            are then $k$ ways to pick the president from the group of $k$. By the <a
                href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/probability-multiplication-rule/a/general-multiplication-rule">multiplication
                rule</a>, there are $k\binom{n}{k}$ ways to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second way is to first pick out a president to be in the group from all $n$ people, and there are $n$
            such possible presidents. Then, from the remaining $n-1$ people, we pick out $k-1$ people (because the
            president is already included in the group). There are $n\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, by combinatorial reasoning, $k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.
