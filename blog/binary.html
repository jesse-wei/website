    <h1>The base-10 system</h1>
    <p>You might have heard that we count in base-10, the decimal counting system. What does that mean?</p>
    <p>Base-10 means there are 10 symbols that we use to count. These symbols are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\).
        Note that there are 10 symbols because \(9 - 0 + 1 = 10\).</p>
    <p>How does our number system work? For decimal numbers, we have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place, and a
        thousands place. 1, 10, 100, and 1000 are all powers of 10: \(10^0,\; 10^1,\; 10^2,\; 10^3\), respectively. In
        this system, 1337 is represented as \(1\times10^3+3\times10^2+3\times10^1+7\times10^0\). That is, there is a 1
        in the thousands place, a 3 in the hundreds place and in the tens place, and a 7 in the ones place. Decimals are
        represented in the same way. 2.1337 is \(2 \times 10 ^ 0 +
        1\times10^{-1}+3\times10^{-2}+3\times10^{-3}+7\times10^{-4}\). This is how we're able to carry numbers when
        adding. If we do \(1337 + 1337\), \(7\times 10^0+7\times 10^0=14=1\times 10^1+4\times 10^0\), so we can put a 4
        in
        the ones place and carry the \(1\) over to the tens place.</p>
    <p>
        Why is this useful? Consider this question: What is the largest 3-digit integer? Clearly, it's 999, which comes
        from putting the greatest symbol into the 3 slots we have. But what if I ask what the largest 8-digit integer
        is? You would have to write eight 9's. Surely, there's a simpler, more general way to write the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the number that is 1 greater, which is a 1 followed by 8 zeroes, \(1\underbrace{00...0}_{8}\). What is
        the value of that number? Well, the highest place value in the number with 8 nines is \(10^7\) we start
        counting from 0 (\(10^0=1\) is the ones place). Then the next place value is \(10^8\), so \(10^8\) is the number
        that
        is 1 greater. So the largest 8-digit integer is \(10^8-1=99999999\). Now, you also know that the largest
        32-digit
        integer is \(10^{32}-1\) and so on. Let's see an example of how this is useful.
    </p>
    <p>You're reading this on a computer right now. Behind the scenes of any computer is code. And code consists of
        variables and variable types: <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>string</code>,
        and <code>bool</code>, for example. Let's focus on
        <code>int</code>. In the C programming language, an <code>unsigned int</code> is a 32-bit data type that stores
        positive integers and 0. What's the greatest number that can be stored in
        an <code>unsigned int</code>?
