    <h1>The base-10 system</h1>
    <p>You might have heard that we count in base-10, the decimal counting system. What does that mean?</p>
    <p>Base-10 means there are 10 symbols that we use to count. These symbols are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\).
        Note that there are 10 symbols because \(9 - 0 + 1 = 10\).</p>
    <p>How does our number system work? For decimal numbers, we have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place, and a
        thousands place. 1, 10, 100, and 1000 are all powers of 10: \(10^0,\; 10^1,\; 10^2,\; 10^3\), respectively. In
        this system, 1337 is represented as \(1\times10^3+3\times10^2+3\times10^1+7\times10^0\). That is, there is a 1
        in the thousands place, a 3 in the hundreds place and in the tens place, and a 7 in the ones place. Decimals are
        represented in the same way. 2.1337 is \(2 \times 10 ^ 0 +
        1\times10^{-1}+3\times10^{-2}+3\times10^{-3}+7\times10^{-4}\). This is how we're able to carry numbers when
        adding. If we do \(1337 + 1337\), \(7\times 10^0+7\times 10^0=14=1\times 10^1+4\times 10^0\), so we can put a 4
        in
        the ones place and carry the \(1\) over to the tens place.</p>
    <p>
        Why is this useful? Consider this question: What is the largest 3-digit integer? Clearly, it's 999, which comes
        from putting the greatest symbol into the 3 slots we have. But what if I ask what the largest 8-digit integer
        is? You would have to write eight 9's. Surely, there's a simpler, more general way to write the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the number that is 1 greater, which is a 1 followed by 8 zeroes, \(1\underbrace{00...0}_{8}\). What is
        the value of that number? Well, the highest place value in the number with 8 nines is \(10^7\) we start
        counting from 0 (\(10^0=1\) is the ones place). Then the next place value is \(10^8\), so \(10^8\) is the number
        that
        is 1 greater. So the largest 8-digit integer is \(10^8-1=99999999\). Now, you also know that the largest
        32-digit
        integer is \(10^{32}-1\) and so on. Let's see an example of how this is useful.
    </p>
    <h1>Binary</h1>
    <p>You're reading this on a computer right now. Behind the scenes of any computer is code. And code consists of
        <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm">variables and variable types</a>:
        <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>string</code>,
        and <code>bool</code>, for example. Let's focus on
        <code>int</code>. In the C programming language, an <code>unsigned int</code> is a 32-bit data type that stores
        positive integers and 0. What's the greatest number that can be stored in
        an <code>unsigned int</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's first talk a bit about binary, though you should have a pretty good understanding of it by now. bi- means
        two, so there are only two symbols in binary: 0 and 1. Here's how we count from \(0_{10}\) to \(7_{10}\) in
        binary:
        <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>100</code>, <code>101</code>,
        <code>110</code>, <code>111</code>. \(0_{10}\) is
        \(0_2\), and \(111_2\) is \(1\times 2^2 + 1\times 2^1 + 1\times 2^0 = 7_{10}\). \(111_2\) is the greatest
        3-bit number: does this match up with what we learned before? The greatest 3-bit number should be
        \(2^3-1=7_{10}\), so it works! Addition and
        <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/two-s-complement">subtraction</a> work the same way as in
        base-10.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the greatest number that can be stored in an <code>unsigned int</code> is \(2^{32}-1 = 4294967295_{10} =
        \text{0xFFFFFFFF}_{16}\), where \(\text{0x}\) denotes <a
            href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal/all">hexadecimal</a>, which is base-16.
        \(16 = 2^4\), so each hex digit is 4 binary digits.
    </p>
    <p>
        \(\textit{Proof.}\) The greatest 32-digit base-2 value is \(\underbrace{111...1}_{32}\). Consider
        \(\underbrace{100...0}_{33}\), the number that is 1 greater. Its value is \(1 \times 2^{32}\), hence
        \(\underbrace{111...1}_{32} = 2^{32} - 1 \). \(\square\)
    </p>
    <h1>Application</h1>
    <p>Why is this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-01-boeing-787-dreamliner-software-bug.html">important</a>?
    </p>
    <img src="/img/boeing.jpeg">
    <p>Boeing mishap</p>
    <p>
        Now you understand why Boeing 787 airplanes have this issue! It's a simple case of integer overflow. Computer
        memory is aligned in chunks, and in C and other programming languages, an <code>unsigned int</code> is specified
        to
        take up 32 bits or \(\frac{32}{8}=4\) bytes, no matter how large or small. \(4294967295_{10} =
        \underbrace{111...1}_{32}\) takes up the same amount of space as does \(1_{10} = \underbrace{000...1}_{32}\).
        Why?
        If memory weren't aligned, such that each number does not have leading zeroes to fill up the allocated 32 bits,
        how could you know where one number ends and another begins?
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, what would happen if we were to add 1 to \(\underbrace{111...1}_{32}\), having just learned that an
        <code>unsigned int</code> cannot have a 33<sup>rd</sup> bit? The ALU of the computer adds 1, but the 33<sup>rd</sup>
        1 is discarded, leaving just \(\underbrace{000...0}_{32} = 0\), an overflow error. Yikes.
    </p>

int main() {
    unsigned int int_max = 0xFFFFFFFF; // F == 1111 == 15 in base-10
    // hence 0xFFFFFFFF is 32 binary bits, all 1's
    printf("%u\n", int_max);
    printf("%u\n", int_max + 1);
