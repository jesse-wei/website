    <h1>My free 19-pg ACT guide</h1>
    <h5><a href="https://bit.ly/3iCP49K">ACT Guide</a></h5>
    <p>My free guide has information about how to study for the test, specific test-taking tips for each section, and resources. I think the study plan and resources are the most important parts because before I started studying, I thought the test was some difficult exam that certainly must require at least a year of practice and at least a few hundred dollars on textbooks and practice questions.</p>
    <p>Frankly, that was a paralyzing mindset. While I had those misconceptions, I didn’t study, and in retrospect, I could’ve been done with the test at least a year earlier.</p>
    <p>After I finally worked up the motivation to actually study, I realized that none of those misconceptions, which are shared by a large portion of students, are actually true. If you study actively, have a good approach, and use the right resources, you can achieve your desired score in only 0-2 months completely for free. I know because that’s how I did it.</p>
    <p>Now, you could hire a tutor (cough cough) to guide you one-on-one, help with specific problems, and speed up the process. Truthfully, tutors are helpful but not necessary if you are good at studying. Equipped with some important knowledge (a study plan, a few tips and strategies, and the correct resources, many of which can be found online for free) and a little elbow grease, you can get a great score in no time.</p>
